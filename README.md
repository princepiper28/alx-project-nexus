Welcome to **Project Nexus**, a GitHub repository dedicated to documenting major learnings from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering program**.  
This serves as a **knowledge hub**, showcasing understanding of frontend engineering concepts, tools, challenges, and best practices acquired throughout the program.  

---

## üéØ Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:  
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.  
- Document major frontend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.  
- Serve as a **reference guide** for both current and future learners.  
- Foster **collaboration** between frontend and backend learners.  

---

## üìö Program Overview

The **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program** provides learners with hands-on experience in modern frontend development, equipping them with skills to build scalable, responsive, and user-friendly applications.  

It runs in parallel with the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**, where backend learners build APIs and services that frontend developers can integrate into their projects. Collaboration between both tracks mirrors **real-world software engineering workflows**.
